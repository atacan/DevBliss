## Overview

DevBliss is a bag of tools to help developers be more productive. We want to use such tools locally instead of in an online website with bunch of ads and privacy concerns.

## Contributing

The structure is based on pointfree.co's [isowords](https://github.com/pointfreeco/isowords) project. Every feature is a library in the swift package and the app's Xcode project is barebones.

### Setup

1. `make start` to set up the pre-commit hooks
1. `open App/DevBliss.xcodeproj` to open the project in Xcode
